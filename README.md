# Data-Visualization-Using-Tableau-and-Gephi
Data Visualization Project for Master's Course

This project explored Airbnb listings in Milan, Italy, with a focus on Municipality 7 (M7). By combining Tableau and Gephi, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of M7's Airbnb landscape, offering insights beyond basic descriptive statistics. Our team, leveraging project management principles, divided the analysis into distinct questions:

1. **M7 vs. Milan:** We compared Airbnb data for M7 with the rest of Milan to understand its unique characteristics.

2.**Unveiling M7's Reputation:** We analyzed general reviews for M7, gaining insights into its overall reputation among guests.

3. **The Heart of M7:**  Using Gephi, we created a sentiment/topic network. This network identified keywords frequently used in M7 reviews, allowing us to develop a compelling narrative about the  area.

4. **Independent Hosts in M7:** Finally, we examined the landscape of independent hosts within M7, providing valuable information for potential future hosts.
